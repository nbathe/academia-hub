<h1>🎓 ACADEMIA HUB </h1>
<h2>📝 About the project</h2>

Academia Hub Provides a separate platform where students can visit and get updates about latest upcoming events held on university or college level. It lists out all the academic activities across the city and universities in chronological order and in subject areas. It provides information about webinars, hackathons, seminars, club events, department events, fests, sports, etc. and categorizes events according to clubs, committees and other college.

   Without an event website and registration page, potential attendees won’t be able to find you, attendance at your event may be low, and you’ll have no data to inform your decision-making to keep attendees engaged. An event website keeps working after your event concludes as a great hub for nurturing leads, networking, and redirecting traffic when everything’s said and done.
Our website is mainly created to provide attendees with a list of upcoming websites with their links. Commonly, a lot of us have a hard time looking up events and finding their pages. Event listing websites make the search operation easy for people.
